HeroProApp
==========

HeroPro App, the Free OpenSource HTML5 / Native app to control, liveview and view content of GoPro HERO cameras.

You can choose either the HTML5 app or the native one (on dev stage)

HeroPro is based on [GoPro WIFI hack repo](https://github.com/KonradIT/goprowifihack)

HTML5
------

An index.html is updated with the latest code. Releases will be anounced below.

Native
-------

As native is difficult to code and I dont have all the devices. Contribution is appreciated.

Contribute
-----------

Please contribute of you know HTML5 or a Native language, or if you know more commands (see commands.md) or testing the app with your camera (bugs must be reported to [my mail](mailto:mail@chernowii.com))
