Native
======

Thanks to PhoneGap, I ported the HTML5 app to native!

Here is a download link to the latest native builds: [link](https://build.phonegap.com/apps/721376/share)

Or, browse the installation files, which be also updated.

We currently support: WP8, Android, Symbian and WebOS. iOS, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Mobile and Blackberry OS are coming soon!

Enjoy!
